        Summit Story
    </h1>
    <p>
        In 1996, our Founder, Kyle Clinkscales, was just a long haired, hippy-looking dirt bag who had a long lived passion for
        coaching and a newfound passion for rock climbing.
        
        At a local gym in Carrollton, Texas he began recruiting a small team, and just like that, Team Texas was born. He
        could’ve fostered one of the greatest youth teams in the nation and called it a day, but if you know Kyle, you know this
        was just the beginning.
        
        He decided on his vision: having his own gym where youth climbers could be built up and adult climbers could find
        likeminded community. With the help of Stan Borodyansky, a team climber turned operational saving grace, our OG
        Grapevine location was acquired and the Summit community was born.
        
        Through the next few years, Summit acquired the Dallas location and that small gym in Carrollton where it all began, and
        Chris LoCrasto, Kyle’s very first team kid, came on as partner and head routesetter for the business.
        
        Since then, Summit has been fortunate enough to open 3 brand new locations in Denton, Fort Worth, and Plano, and expand
        our community into Norman and Oklahoma City.
