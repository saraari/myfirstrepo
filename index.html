            <p>
                I started climbing about 7 years ago.
                I started with a program called Climb Fit.
                My favorite form of climbing is called deep water solo.
                There are various forms of climbing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead Climbing</li>
                    <li>Bouldering</li>
                    <li>Deep Water Solo</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                      The gym where I climb at is called Summit. Here is a link to their website:

                Dirt Biking
            </h3>
            <p>
                I started dirt biking a little over a year ago.
                My favorite place to ride is in Los Cabos Mexico.
                Jherich Silas taught me how to ride.
