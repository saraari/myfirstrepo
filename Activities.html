    <h2>Dirt Biking</h2>
<p>
    Dirt biking is the best! It was very scary when I first started but has developed into one of the most enjoyable
    activities of my life. When you are riding, you will forget all your problems and just have a blast!

<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
<p>
    Rock climbing got me into the best shape I’ve have ever been in. Being able to literally climb mountains is such a
    rush and gives you a level of confidence like you’ve never experienced.

<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>
    Traveling is my favorite thing to do. I love being able to see the world and all it has to offer. I have traveled
    out of the country multiple times and have been to 40 out the 50 states in the USA. Three of my favorite trips were
    to Washington state, Los Cabos Mexico, and Ontario Canada.
