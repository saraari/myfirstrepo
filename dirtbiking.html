        Story of dirt biking
    </h1>
    <p>
        It wasn't until the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s that dirt bikes began to take on their own distinct designs. Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, and Kawasaki all began mass-producing two-stroke motorbikes that could be driven on trails and in campgrounds, paving the way for the motocross market as we know it today.

In 1951, Austrian engineer Hans Trunkenpolz designed his first prototype â€“ the R100. Within the next few years, the business was named Kronreif and Trunkenpolz Mattighofen (KTM). Having secured its first racing titles and making its first appearance at the International Six Days Trial, KTM quickly demonstrated its dominance over the enduro scene. KTM dirt bikes are also consistently the lightest or among the lightest in their class.

In the decades that followed, dirt biking earned a loyal following of riders in enduro, motocross, supercross, and trials. Four-stroke dirt bikes quickly replaced two-stroke dirt bikes. However, KTM has been persistent about maintaining a balance of two-stroke and four-stroke options for competitive riders. Today, the industry-leading brand offers the widest and most comprehensive collection of off-road bikes.
