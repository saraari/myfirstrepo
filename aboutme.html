    <h1 class="aboutMe">About Me</h1>
    <article class="article1">
<p>
    My career path has been very diverse over the years. I have been a customer service representative who answers phone
    calls all day, to a healthcare professional, to traveling the nation as a software and hardware installation
    specialist, to a leader in training and education. Most people reach a point in their life when they decide what
    they want to make their forever career. The answer for me was technology. I think technology is one of the things
    that makes the human race amazing, and I want to be a part of it as much as I can.
</p>
<p>
    I have a passion for learning new skills and am always ready to broaden my knowledge and experience. I also highly
    value my experience in training and educational development. Being the go-to person for my team and helping people
    come to a better understanding of things, is very important to me. I also believe that diversity and inclusion is
    one of the biggest keys to being a successful professional.

    <h2 class="secondaryHeadings">Front End Developer:</h2>
    Becoming a front-end developer has been one of my most exciting decisions. Being a part of the creation process is
    an amazing experience. Currently I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my stack with VS Code as my IDE. For
    version control and collaboration, I am using GitHub. I have been able to contribute to multiple projects and enjoy
    working with other developers and web professionals.
    </p>
    <h2 class="secondaryHeadings">Software Implementation:</h2>
    <p>
        I have expertise in preparation for large and complex projects. Having effective communication, strategic time
        management, and planning are key skills. I have extensive experience with data validation to ensure the accuracy
        of critical data. I am also familiar with SQL, specifically Microsoft SQL, both reviewing data and writing
        queries. I am particularly adept at understanding the lifecycle process of a product. This enables me to
        identify challenges and find solutions across various disciplines.
    </p>
    <h2 class="secondaryHeadings">Hardware Specialist:</h2>
    <p>
        I have been a regional lead for installing new hardware and integrating existing hardware with various
        software platforms. I worked with setting up workstations, servers, robots, point of sales, printers, and
        networking components, in addition to other hardware and peripherals. Being able to research and collaborate are
        two key pieces of why I have been able to excel in this field, as well as others.
    </p>
    <h2 class="secondaryHeadings">Leader in Training and Education:</h2>
    <p>
        I love being able to help my teams learn and grow. I can communicate effectively with people from diverse
        backgrounds. I have trained clients as diverse as hospital directors and doctors, to retail store cashiers. I
        have traveled across the country, training and educating hundreds of people. I enjoy creating training materials
        and utilizing learning system platforms to teach and convey information that is accessible for everyone.
    </p>
    <h2 class="secondaryHeadings">Healthcare Professional:</h2>
    <p>
        I have over 10 years experience in the healthcare industry. I have developed a comprehensive understanding of
        security and compliance due to my many years of working with protected and confidential information. I can
        identify areas of risk and vulnerability, providing compliance solutions. Working with patients who have chronic
        conditions has driven me to develop acute skills in attention to detail. I have been the senior technician for a
        healthcare facility, where utilizing these skills was crucial.
